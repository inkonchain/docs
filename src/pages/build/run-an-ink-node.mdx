# Running an Ink Node

Welcome to the [Ink Node] setup tutorial. Follow these steps to deploy and sync your own node efficiently.

## Tutorial Goals

By the end of this guide, you will:

- Successfully deploy an [Ink Node].
- Ensure your node is in sync with the network.

## Before You Begin

<Callout emoji="⚠️" type='warning'>
Running a node is resource-intensive and time-consuming. Make sure you have a clear purpose for setting up your node.

For those starting out and needing an RPC URL, our free endpoints are available:

- **Mainnet**: `not available yet`
- **Testnet (Sepolia)**: `https://rpc-gel-sepolia.inkonchain.com/`

**Note:** These RPCs are rate-limited and unsuitable for production applications.
</Callout>

### System Requirements

To run a node, your system should meet these minimum specifications:

- 8-Core CPU
- 8 GB RAM or more
- SSD drive (NVME recommended) with at least 100GB storage

Running an archive node will demand additional disk space over time. More CPU and RAM will enhance performance with higher RPC traffic.

### Software Prerequisites

Ensure [Docker] is installed and running on your machine. Familiarity with [Docker] is assumed.

### Optional: Custom L1 RPC URL

By default, the [Ink Node] repository leverages public L1 RPC & Beacon APIs. For more stability, we encourage you to use your own L1 RPC and Beacon APIs.

## Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Clone the Repository:** [Ink Node repository](https://github.com/inkonchain/node).

2. **Run Setup Script:**
   ```sh
   ./setup.sh
   ```

3. **Optional Configuration:**
   Create a `.env` file at the root and set the following variables:
   ```sh
   L1_RPC_URL=your_rpc_url
   L1_BEACON_URL=your_beacon_url
   ```

4. **Start the Node:**
   ```sh
   docker compose up # --build to force rebuild the images
   ```

Syncing your node may take several days. Monitor usage and plan accordingly.

## Verifying Sync Status

### Using op-node API

Check the sync status using the `optimism_syncStatus` method:
```sh
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" --data \
    '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"optimism_syncStatus","params":[],"id":1}' \
    http://localhost:9545 | jq
```

### Using op-geth API

To verify if your node is fully synced, use the `eth_blockNumber` method:
```sh
curl http://localhost:8545 -X POST \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    --data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"eth_blockNumber","params": [],"id":1}' | jq -r .result | sed 's/^0x//' | awk '{printf "%d\n", "0x" $0}';
```

A synced node will display the latest block number as seen on the [block explorer](https://explorer-sepolia.inkonchain.com/).

### Comparing with Ink Public RPC

Compare your local node's finalized block with the public RPC block:
```sh
local_block=$(curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8545 -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"eth_getBlockByNumber","params":["finalized", false],"id":1}' \
  | jq -r .result.number | sed 's/^0x//' | awk '{printf "%d\n", "0x" $0}'); \
public_rpc_block=$(curl -s -X POST https://rpc-gel-sepolia.inkonchain.com/ -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
 --data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"eth_getBlockByNumber","params":["finalized", false],"id":1}' \
 | jq -r .result.number | sed 's/^0x//' | awk '{printf "%d\n", "0x" $0}'); \
echo -e "Local finalized block: $local_block\nRemote finalized block: $public_rpc_block"
```

A synced node will have equal local and remote finalized blocks:
```text
Local finalized block: 4449608
Remote finalized block: 4449608
```
