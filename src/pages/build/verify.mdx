# Kraken Verify

Kraken Verify is a service that allows users to create an onchain attestation linking their wallet address to their verified Kraken account. This creates a trusted connection between a user's Kraken identity and their blockchain activity, enabling access to exclusive features across the Ink ecosystem.

Kraken Verify uses the [Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS)](https://attest.org/) on Ink to issue onchain attestations. These attestations only store the wallet address and verification confirmation - no personal information is published onchain. Gas fees are covered by Kraken, making verification free for users.

Users can verify one address at a time, with the ability to revoke and re-verify with a new address as needed. To prevent abuse, users can perform up to 20 verifications per year. These verifications are non-transferable and provide a secure way to access verified-only features.

## Installation

```bash
  # Using npm
  npm install @krakenfx/verify

  # Using yarn
  yarn add @krakenfx/verify

  # Using pnpm
  pnpm add @krakenfx/verify
```

## Setup

### Remappings

Generate remappings for Foundry:

```bash
  forge remappings > remappings.txt
```

You might need to add this extra one manually if you're using pnpm:

```txt
  @ethereum-attestation-service/=node_modules/.pnpm/@ethereum-attestation-service+eas-contracts@1.8.0/node_modules/@ethereum-attestation-service
```

### IDE Configuration

Update your IDE to support remappings. For VS Code:

```json
// .vscode/settings.json
{
  "solidity.remappings": ["...=node_modules/..."]
}
```

## Usage

### Solidity

```solidity
  // SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
  pragma solidity 0.8.24;

  import { KrakenVerifyAccessControl } from "@krakenfx/verify/src/abstracts/KrakenVerifyAccessControl.sol";

  contract MyContract is KrakenVerifyAccessControl {
      // Only users with valid Kraken Verify attestations can call this function
      function verifiedUserFunction() external onlyVerified {
          // Your implementation
      }
  }
```

### JavaScript / TypeScript Client

The package also provides a client for checking address verification status directly from JavaScript or TypeScript applications. This can be useful for frontend applications that need to verify user addresses before displaying certain features or content.

#### ESM / TypeScript

```typescript
// ES Modules / TypeScript
import { VerifyClient } from "@krakenfx/verify";

const verifyClient = new VerifyClient();
const yourAddress = "0x2193981f2d65149644C039c9071f2bE8b5938F0B";

// Check if an address is verified
const isVerified = await verifyClient.isAddressVerified(yourAddress);

console.log(`Result: ${isVerified ? "✅ Verified" : "❌ Not verified"}`);
```

#### CommonJS

```javascript
// CommonJS
const { VerifyClient } = require("@krakenfx/verify");

const verifyClient = new VerifyClient();
const yourAddress = "0x2193981f2d65149644C039c9071f2bE8b5938F0B";

// Check if an address is verified
async function checkVerification() {
  const isVerified = await verifyClient.isAddressVerified(yourAddress);
  console.log(`Result: ${isVerified ? "✅ Verified" : "❌ Not verified"}`);
}

checkVerification();
```

#### Configuration Options

You can customize the client by passing options to the constructor:

```typescript
const verifyClient = new VerifyClient({
  rpcUrl: "https://your-rpc-endpoint.com", // Custom RPC URL
  verbose: true, // Enable verbose logging
});
```

## What's Included

- Supporting libraries and interfaces for attestation verification
- JavaScript/TypeScript client for checking address verification status

## Requirements

- Solidity 0.8.24
- Node.js 16+ (for client usage)

## License
