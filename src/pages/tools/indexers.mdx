# Indexers

## [The Graph](https://thegraph.com/)

Getting historical data on smart contracts can be frustrating when building a dapp. [The Graph](https://thegraph.com/) offers a powerful way to query smart contract data with open APIs known as subgraphs. Anyone can create or query subgraphs, making the data available to the entire ecosystem. The Graph is powered by hundreds of independent Indexers, enabling your dapp to become truly decentralized.

With The Graph, you can benefit from:
 - **Decentralized Indexing, Built to Scale**: Tap into a global network of Indexers to efficiently index blockchain data with no single point of failure–just resilient infrastructure. 
 - **Powerful GraphQL Interface**: Query blockchain data using GraphQL. It’s fast and flexible, accelerating data retrieval to enhance your dapps. 
 - **Customizable Data Logic**: Define your own logic for transforming and storing blockchain data. Reuse subgraphs published by other developers on The Graph Network.

**Supported Networks**

* Ink Mainnet
* Ink Sepolia

### Quick Start

These subgraphs only take a few minutes to set up. Follow this [quick-start](https://thegraph.com/docs/en/quick-start/) guide to create, deploy, and query a subgraph within 5 minutes.

Pricing: **All developers receive 100K free monthly queries on the decentralized network**. After these free queries, you only pay based on usage at $2 for every 100K queries.
