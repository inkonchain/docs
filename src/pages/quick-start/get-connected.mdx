## What do I Need to Start Developing on Ink?
1. An IDE (integrated developer environment) like [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/) to write smart contracts in solidity.
1. A wallet that holds ETH such as [Kraken Wallet](https://www.kraken.com/wallet).
    - We suggest having at least 0.05 ETH for standard deployments on Ink.
    - You can request Ink Sepolia ETH using our [Faucets](/quick-start/faucets).
1. We recommend using a development framework like [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/) or [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/)
