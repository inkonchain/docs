# Frequently Asked Questions

## Ink

### What makes Ink different?
Ink is an OP Stack Layer 2 launched with 1-second blocktimes. What sets us apart is our dedication to building a comprehensive DeFi ecosystem while staying true to our origins. Our mission is to simplify DeFi while bringing Kraken’s core principles—security, user experience, and privacy—onchain.

We embrace our cypherpunk roots by shipping rapidly and iteratively. Feedback from users, developers, and the broader onchain community is vital to us as we strive to create the ultimate platform for achieving individual financial sovereignty.

### What’s the difference between Ethereum and OP Stack chains?
OP Stack chains are designed to be EVM equivalent and introduces as few changes as possible to the Ethereum protocol. 

For a full run down on all differences please refer to [Optimism’s documentation](https://docs.optimism.io/stack/differences). 

For convenience, a few notable points worth mentioning are:
- [Opcodes](https://docs.optimism.io/stack/differences#opcodes)
- [Bridging](https://docs.optimism.io/stack/differences#bridging)
- [Chain Finality](https://docs.optimism.io/stack/differences#chain-finality)

### Are there any native bridging options?
At the moment, Ink does not host its own bridging portal. Please review our recognized partner’s bridges here: https://inkonchain.com/dashboard


### Why are fees/bridging high?
Ink cannot control gas fees or platform fees which vary subject to chain congestion and platform discretion. Please feel free to DYOR and explore multiple options available at https://inkonchain.com/dashboard

Kraken also supports the Ink network with zero withdrawal fees. If you want to buy ETH and then send it to your wallet, this is another option.


### Is developing on and using Ink expensive?
Not at all! As an L2 built on the Optimism stack Ink benefits from extremely low fees. L2 users do pay an extra fee to settle L2 data on L1 (Ethereum mainnet). Please see [Fees](/build/transaction-fees) for more information.

You can deploy anything! While we may be a DeFi chain, we encourage developers of all types to deploy. Check out our [tutorials](/build/tutorials) to get started.
