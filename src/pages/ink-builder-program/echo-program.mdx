# Echo Program Track  

Whether you shipped infra, launched a dApp, ran community calls, or quietly supported Ink’s growth during its early days, Echo exists to recognize those contributions, wherever and however they happened.

## What Is Echo?

Echo is Ink’s retroactive builder track – a one-time initiative to recognize and reward the early contributors whose work helped shape the foundation of the Ink ecosystem.

Before there was Spark or Forge, there were builders who believed – experimenting, testing, and building in the dark so Ink could shine later. Echo exists to make sure those efforts are remembered, rewarded, and reconnected to what comes next.

## Why We Created Echo

Ecosystems aren’t born overnight. They emerge from countless unseen contributions across lines of code, design mockups, ideas, feedback, and belief.

Echo was created to:
- Recognize the builders, creators, and community members who gave Ink its first pulse. 
- Celebrate meaningful early contributions that came before structured programs existed. 
- Reconnect past contributors and invite them to shape Ink’s next era. 

We’re here because of the work that came before. Echo ensures that past work continues to resonate.

## Who is Echo For? 

Echo is for the people and projects that helped bring Ink to life.

We’re recognizing those who:
- Shipped products or tools on Ink before November 1st. 
- Created real value for Ink’s community, users, or technical stack. 
- Embodied Ink’s open, product-first builder ethos. 

Whether you were a core developer, indie founder, ecosystem partner, or community catalyst, if your work left an imprint on Ink’s early growth, you’re part of this story.

## How It Works

Echo is a one-time, limited-scope initiative designed for fairness, speed, and clarity.

1. **Submit**

Share a short summary of your past contribution including: 
- What you built or did. 
- When and how it happened. 
- Proof of work (links, commits, screenshots, metrics, dev wallet, etc.)

2. **Review**

Our review team, including Ink Foundation members and ecosystem advisors, will evaluate submissions based on impact, clarity, and authenticity.

3. **Reward & Reconnect**

Selected contributors receive a retroactive grant and a personal invitation to rejoin the builder network for upcoming initiatives.
