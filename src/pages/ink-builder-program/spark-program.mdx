# Spark Program Track 

*Every big idea starts with a spark.*

## What is Spark? 

Spark is Ink’s lightweight builder track for experimentation, side projects, and indie hackers testing ideas onchain.

Whether you’re shipping a tool, exploring a UX concept, or building memes with code, Spark gives you just enough support to get started. No pitch decks. No bureaucracy. Just your idea and a place in the Ink ecosystem.

This is where new ideas get their first “**yes**.”

## Why We Built Spark

Thriving ecosystems transcend grants funding. They flourish through the ingenuity of the curious, chaotic, and creative.  

The ones who tinker first and think later. The ones who just want to see what happens.

Spark exists to:
- Reduce entry hurdles for emerging creators. 
- Capture those initial bursts of innovation. 
- Foster an Ink environment that’s welcoming and inclusive. 

You don’t need a 50-page roadmap to matter—just a working idea and the will to ship.

Big things often have small beginnings, and even the most modest of experiments can grow into the next core primitive. Spark fuels that transformation. 

## Who is Spark for? 

- Indie hackers, first-time builders, and creative experimenters. 
- Projects with small tools, minimum viable products (MVPs), or early-stage prototypes.  
- Builders without a token or team – just code and curiosity. 

## What Can You Build?

- Developer tools and smart contract experiments.
- Onchain games, bots, or meme apps. 
- Creator or community tools artists or group engagement. 
- Prototypes of public resources. 
- Anything that makes Ink more fun, usable, or composable. 

## How It Works
