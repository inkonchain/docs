# Ink Builder Program

The Ink Builder Program comprises three tracks to support ecosystem development through targeted funding, guidance, and recognition.

- **Spark**: Entry-level track for individual builders and prototypes. Targets onchain experiments (e.g., tools, games). Provides 500 – 5,000 USDC microgrants, rapid reviews, and promotion; no pitches required.
- **Forge**: Advanced track for teams with MVPs. Focuses on dApps, DeFi, and infrastructure. Offers up to 200,000 USDC in milestone grants, advisory, integrations, and investor connections.
- **Echo**: One-time retroactive track for pre-launch contributors (before November 1st). Rewards code, tools, or community efforts with grants, acknowledgment, and program access.

The builder tracks enable progression from ideation to scale while honoring Ink’s origins. 
Applications are open to all eligible builders.
