# Forge Program Track 

The future isn’t written. It’s waiting to be inked.

## What is Forge? 

If Spark is where ideas begin, Forge is where builders scale.

Forge is Ink’s flagship builder track designed for serious teams shipping real products that push the ecosystem forward.

Whether you’re launching the next great dApp, building protocol infrastructure, or creating tools that make Ink easier to use, Forge backs you with meaningful funding, strategic guidance, and long-term support.

This is where prototypes become products.

## Why We Built Forge 

Every builder hits that familiar turning point where the idea is real, the product works, and the path ahead is both exciting and uncertain.

Forge exists for that moment. 

It’s for founders ready to scale, teams turning experiments into ecosystems, and individuals transforming creative energy into structure.

Forge is rooted in our conviction that:
- Great products deserve committed backing and care. 
- Builders thrive when they’re connected, guided, and empowered.
- Ink evolves when its best ideas are built to endure. 

You bring the vision. We’ll help you forge it into reality.
