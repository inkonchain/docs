## Welcome To Ink

> Awarded for bridging Ethereum to Ink.

To bridge Ethereum, you can use the `L1StandardBridge` on the sepolia network crafted for the Inkchain.

There are two ways to do it:

### Gelato Bridge app

The app provides a very simple UI to deposit or withdraw SepoliaETH from and to Sepolia Ink.

Here is the app: https://testnet-bridge.gelato.network/bridge/ink-sepolia

Connect your wallet, select the amount to transfer, and that's it!

### Directly calling the contract

You can call the `bridgeETH` method in the contract here: https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0xC0d337f71aD19a8f17a1b297cDb3a86c5EEf9Eec#writeProxyContract

For instance, if you want to bridge 1 Sepolia ETH into 1 Sepolia "Ink" ETH:

1. Connect your Wallet using the "Connect to Web3" button
2. Expand the `bridgeETH` method and enter `bridgeETH: 1`
3. Enter `_minGasLimit: 1000` (or whatever suits you)
4. Enter `_extraData: 0x00`
5. Click "Write", then validate the transaction in MetaMask, then sign it to complete the transaction.

## Wrapped ETH

> Awarded for wrapping Ethereum into WETH.

To create Wrapped ETH tokens (WETH), you can interact with the `deposit` method in the contract here: https://explorer-sepolia.inkonchain.com/token/0x47d1f931eaff721549cc0ad57da81729baa8b4b2?tab=write_contract

1. Connect your Wallet using the button
2. Expand the `deposit` method and enter `Send native ETH: 10 000 000 000 000 000`.
  * This is equivalent to 0.01 ETH, adjust as needed
3. Click "Write", then validate the transaction in MetaMask, then sign it to complete the transaction.

If you want the token to appear in MetaMask, click on the MetaMask button at the top of the page
